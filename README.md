Evergreeen Book Store is a web-based application that sells books online. Users can view books from the home page, they can click on a book to see details, they can create an account, login, add an item to cart.
Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, API.
Tools used: Visual Studio as a code editor, Postman to test the API, MongoDB atlas as DataBase to store and querry the data. 
The CRUD in the back end is fully working. We are able to Register a user, get all the users, get a user by ID, update a User information and delete a User. 
In the client side. The register and login features are fully working. From our frontend, we are able to register a user and login to the application. 
However, we are still working on other features of the application, like logout, add to cart, allow the user to see a book details when they click on it. Also, we are still working to redirect the user to home page when they create an account or login. 
But the application is already working. We are able to store the user information from the backend using our API tool Postman and from the frontend by creating a new account. 
We are also still working on deploying this application.
